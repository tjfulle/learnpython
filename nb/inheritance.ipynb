The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on the game that you are playing, an Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.\n",

    "If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is obvious what the attributes should be: ``rank`` and ``suit``. It is not as obvious what type the attributes should be. One possibility is to use strings containing words like `'Spade'` for suits and `'Queen'` for ranks. One problem with this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to see which had a higher rank or suit.\n",

    "An alternative is to use integers to [encode](glossary.ipynb#encode) the ranks and suits. In this context, “encode” means that we are going to define a mapping between numbers and suits, or between numbers and ranks. This kind of encoding is not meant to be a secret (that would be\n",
